Knowing the basics about a bird’s coloring can help you do just that. While genetics play an important role in feather coloring, it gets super confusing so we’ll just focus on the fun stuff here.</p><ul><li><strong>Pigments</strong> - There are only two pigments that exist within poultry feather genetics: black and red. Every recognized color variety is made up of these two pigments, whether they are enhanced, diluted, or masked. These gene changes are manipulated by us humans through selective breeding.<br><br></li><li><strong>Gender </strong>- Males always have brighter and more colorful plumage intended to attract a mate. Females typically have more understated and subtle colors to camouflage them while sitting on a nest of eggs.</li></ul></div></div></div><hr class="full-width"><p><strong>BODY COLORS</strong><br><br>Here’s a gallery of the variety of feather colors that are out there.
